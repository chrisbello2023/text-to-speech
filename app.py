including feedback from many people internal and external to OpenAI. The timeline to AGI remains uncertain, 

but our Charter will guide us in acting in the best interests of humanity throughout its development.

OpenAIâ€™s mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)â€”by which we mean 

highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable workâ€”benefits all of humanity.

We will attempt to directly build safe and beneficial AGI, but will also consider our mission fulfilled 

if our work aids others to achieve this outcome. To that end, we commit to the following principles:

Broadly distributed benefits
